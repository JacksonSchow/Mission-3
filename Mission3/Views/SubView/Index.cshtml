            More programming experience is one thing I know I'll get out of this class. I hope that I'll be able to get better with html,
            css, bootstrap, and JavaScript. I hope that it is a good semester. I honestly don't know what to keep typing, but I want to
            make sure that I have enough here to make it look like a paragraph. Just ran the program and it didn't look like much of anything at all.
            Imma just copy and paste what I already have to double the size. More programming experience is one thing I know I'll get out of this class.
